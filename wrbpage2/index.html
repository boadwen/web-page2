      Sub-Saharan Africa's top 10 remittance recipients in 2022

  <div class="subtext">
    <p>I would like to tell to who ever is reading this 
      this is me re-making a page to test the skill that i have gained by 
      learning front-end web development, the text and the image can be found in 
      <a href="https://benjamindada.com">benjamindada</a> webpage
      this was remastered by boadwen.

    <div class="left-text"><p>Nigeria accounts for highest remittance flow in sub-saharan africa</p></div>
  </div>
  <div class="future">
    <p>'This is going to be a text don't mean anything special', "remittances have become a financil lifeline in many economies through the
      pandemic and will become even more so in the foreseeable future, says Dilip Ratha, head of KNOMAD."</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bank">
    <p>'This is also going to be a text about nothing special', "in 2022, remittance flows to sub-saharan africa reached $53 billion, a 6,1% increase from the previous year, according to <a href="#">a report by the world bank and KNOMAD</a>. The increase in remittance flows to the region supported the current accounts of several African countries dealing with food insecurity, supply chain disruptions, severe drounght(horn of Africa), floods(in Nigeria, Chad, Niger, burkina Faso, Mali, and Cameroon), and dept-servicing difficulties."</p>
  </div>
  <div class="green">
    <ul>
   <li><p class="billion">'This is unnecessary text with green background', "Remittances flows to Sub-saharan Africa were nearly twice the size of FDI flows, and relatively more stable, in 2022. FDI flows to the region reached 
      a historic high of $76 billion in 2021, driven primarily by a large corporate financial transaction in South Africa -- a stock exchange between Naspers and Prosus"</p></li>
     </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="nigeria">
      <h3>Remittances to Nigeria accounted for about 38% (20.1 billion) of total remittances inflows to the Sub-Saharan Africa region</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="diaspora">
      <p>'This is a more useless information', "Fintech startups on the continent are leveraging this high inflow to drive their innovation. Last year, nigeria neobank, <a href="#">Kuba expanded its operations into the UK</a> to offers its remittance services for Nigerians in the diaspora."</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p>'Africans in the [diaspora] are faced with barrier after barrier when it comes to financial services, from challenges setting up accounts to 
        prohibitive and inconsistent fees on meaningful transfers. They are forced to limit each trasfer to a few hundred pounds to avoid losing money or face escalating exchange rates with bigger transfers.'
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>'According to the World Bank, Sub-Saharan africa remains the region with the highest remittance costs. To send $200 to the region in the last quarter of 2022 cost an average of 8.0% of the amount.'</p>
